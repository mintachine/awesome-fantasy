[The Dark](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397861.The_Dark) (1980) *by [James Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Herbert)* [3.85]

Often likened to The Fog by the same author, The Dark stands out to me as the superior book as it has action and terror, thrills, and creepy paranormal elements that will keep you gripped.  I've enjoyed most of Herbert's books, but I recommend that readers start with this one. - [@mintachine](https://github.com/mintachine)

In slimy tunnels, once-human creatures gathered. Madness raged as the lights began to fade and humanity was attacked by an ancient, unstoppable evil.
